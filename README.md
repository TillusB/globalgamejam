## Global Game Jam 2019

This project was developed within two days during the Global Game Jam 2019.
Unfortunately it never reached completion.

Feel free to look around anyway.

# The Game

Our idea was a frantic 4 player local co-op sidescroller, where the players try to keep their walking house from colliding with obstacles.  
Every player has a designated colour and must take care of obstacles and fuel pickups of that corresponding colour.  
The house has four colored compartements for fuel storage from which it consumes 1 bit of fuel per color each second.  
Players work together by throwing pickups at eachother, throwing eachother and yelling constantly while the house breaks down more and more.
